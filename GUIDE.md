## 🎮 Feature Guide

### ⌨️ HID Keyboard & Mouse (OTG Mode)
ScrcpyGUI v3 features advanced hardware simulation (HID) for a lag-free experience.
- **HID Keyboard**: Simulates a real USB keyboard. This is the **only way** to fix issues with Polish accents, special characters, and international layouts.
- **HID Mouse**: Provides a high-precision, native cursor feel. Eliminates the "double cursor" or lag found in standard mirroring.
- **Pure HID (No Mirror)**: Perfect for when you only want to use your PC as a "controller" for your phone (e.g., typing long messages or playing games while looking at the phone screen).

### 📹 Pro Camera Mode (Webcam)
Turn your phone into a professional webcam.
1. Change **Capture Source** to **Camera**.
2. Select your lens (Back, Front, or even the Ultra-Wide lens).
3. Set your desired **FPS** (up to 60fps supported on most modern phones).
4. **OBS Integration**: Open **OBS Studio**, add a "Window Capture" source, and select the ScrcpyGUI window. Use OBS's **Virtual Camera** to use your phone in Zoom, Teams, or Discord.

### 🖥 Graphics Renderer (Render API)
You can choose which graphics renderer scrcpy should request for video display.

- **Auto**: Recommended default. Lets scrcpy choose the best renderer.
- **Manual Selection**: Options like Direct3D, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Metal, or Software may appear.

Renderer choices are **capability-aware**:

- ScrcpyGUI reads what your installed scrcpy build advertises.
- ScrcpyGUI filters options by your host OS.
- Unsupported options are hidden automatically.

Examples:

- Windows typically shows Direct3D/OpenGL/OpenGL ES/Software (no Metal).
- macOS may show Metal/OpenGL/OpenGL ES/Software.
- Linux typically shows OpenGL/OpenGL ES/Software.

If a renderer is selected manually, ScrcpyGUI passes it to scrcpy with `--render-driver`.

### 📂 File Transfers & APKs
- **Install Apps**: Just drag an `.apk` file from your PC and drop it anywhere into the ScrcpyGUI window.
- **Transfer Files**: Drag any file into the window to automatically push it to your device's `/sdcard/Download/` folder.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Device not found?**: Try a different USB port or cable. Ensure "USB Debugging" is still active.
- **Laggy video?**: Lower the **Bitrate** (8M-12M is usually perfect) or the **Resolution**.
- **ADB Error?**: If commands are failing, click the **Kill ADB** button in the sidebar. This resets the connection bridge without closing the app.
- **Binary Error?**: If the app says it cannot find scrcpy, use the **Downloader** in the top right corner.
